# Automatic alignment with Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)

 Forced aligners are softwares that automatically align transcripts to the corresponding audio. For linguists, they can save a lot of time spent on annotating recordings. [Montreal Forced Aligner](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) is one of the aligners I found that are easy to use and could produce very good results. In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the installation and some basic functions of MFA and share some tricks and code snippets that might be helpful.

The structure of the tutorial:

0. **Introduction**
1. **Installation**
	1. [Set up MFA](Set_up_MFA.md)
	2. [Install Kaldi on Linux/macOS](Install_Kaldi.md)
2. **Alignment with MFA**
	1. [Start from a single recording](Start_with_a_single_recording.md)
	2. [Batch processing](Batch_processing.md)
3. [Other tools for automatic phonetic transcription](Other_tools_for_automatic_phonetic_transcription)

This guide was based on MFA 2.0.0a21, and was prepared for a workshop in the [Phonetics Laboratory at University of Toronto](http://www.utphonetics.ca).
