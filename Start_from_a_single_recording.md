## Create the transcript
Each audio file needs to be accompanied by a text file which includes its transcript. The transcript file can have the suffixes '.txt' or '.lab'. In the transcript file:
1. **ALL** the sounds in the recording should be transcribed;
2. all the characters should be in uppercase;
3. all the punctuation marks should be removed.



### If you don't have the transcript
